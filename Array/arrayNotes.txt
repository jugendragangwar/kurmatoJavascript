========================================Difference Between Array and object======================================
=>Array (position[index] matter)
1.Arrays are best to use when the elements are numbers.
2.The data inside an array is known as Elements.
3.The elements can be manipulated using [].  
4.The elements can be popped out of an array using the pop() function.
5.Iterating through an array is possible using For loop, For..in, For..of, and ForEach().

=>Array of objects(key matter)
1.Objects are best to use when the elementsâ€™ strings (text).
2.The data inside objects are known as Properties which consists of a key and a value.
3.The properties can be manipulated using both.DOT notation and [].
4.The keys or properties can be deleted by using the delete keyword.
5.Iterating through an array of objects is possible using For..in, For..of, and ForEach().

============================for loop====================
const name=["Prasang","kapil","Sharik","aman","Ambuj","Vishal"];

for(let i=0;i<name.length;i++){
    console.log(name[i]);
}

=============================for-of loop========================
const students=["Prasang","kapil","Sharik","aman","Ambuj","Vishal","Varun"];
 
for(let name of students){
    console.log(name);
}

========================use method of string in Array==========================
let cities=["delhi","pune","mumbai","gurgaon","hyderabd"];
for(let city of cities){
    console.log(city.toUpperCase());
}
